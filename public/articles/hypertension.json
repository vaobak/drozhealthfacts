  "content": "Hypertension, commonly known as high blood pressure, is a chronic medical condition affecting nearly half of all American adults approximately 116 million people. Often called the \"silent killer\" because it typically has no symptoms, hypertension is a major risk factor for heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, and other serious health complications.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding hypertension, its causes, and effective management strategies is crucial for preventing life-threatening complications and maintaining optimal cardiovascular health. This comprehensive guide provides evidence-based information to help you take control of your blood pressure and protect your long-term health.\r\n\r\n## What Is Hypertension?\r\n\r\nHypertension occurs when the force of blood against your artery walls is consistently too high. Think of it like water pressure in a garden hose when the pressure is too high, it can damage the hose over time. Similarly, high blood pressure damages your blood vessels and organs.\r\n\r\n### Blood Pressure Readings Explained\r\n\r\nBlood pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg) and recorded as two numbers:\r\n\r\n**Systolic Pressure** (Top Number)\r\n- Pressure when your heart beats and pumps blood\r\n- Reflects the force against artery walls during contraction\r\n- Higher number of the two\r\n\r\n**Diastolic Pressure** (Bottom Number)\r\n- Pressure when your heart rests between beats\r\n- Reflects the force when the heart is filling with blood\r\n- Lower number of the two\r\n\r\n### Blood Pressure Categories\r\n\r\nAccording to the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology:\r\n\r\n**Normal**\r\n- Systolic: Less than 120 mmHg\r\n- Diastolic: Less than 80 mmHg\r\n- Example: 115/75 mmHg\r\n\r\n**Elevated**\r\n- Systolic: 120-129 mmHg\r\n- Diastolic: Less than 80 mmHg\r\n- Example: 125/78 mmHg\r\n- Warning sign lifestyle changes needed\r\n\r\n**Hypertension Stage 1**\r\n- Systolic: 130-139 mmHg\r\n- Diastolic: 80-89 mmHg\r\n- Example: 135/85 mmHg\r\n- Lifestyle changes + possible medication\r\n\r\n**Hypertension Stage 2**\r\n- Systolic: 140 mmHg or higher\r\n- Diastolic: 90 mmHg or higher\r\n- Example: 145/95 mmHg\r\n- Lifestyle changes + medication required\r\n\r\n**Hypertensive Crisis** (Emergency)\r\n- Systolic: Higher than 180 mmHg\r\n- Diastolic: Higher than 120 mmHg\r\n- Example: 185/125 mmHg\r\n- Seek immediate medical attention\r\n\r\n### Types of Hypertension\r\n\r\n**Primary (Essential) Hypertension**\r\n- 90-95% of all cases\r\n- No identifiable cause\r\n- Develops gradually over years\r\n- Related to genetics and lifestyle factors\r\n\r\n**Secondary Hypertension**\r\n- 5-10% of cases\r\n- Caused by underlying condition\r\n- Often appears suddenly\r\n- Higher blood pressure than primary\r\n- Treatable by addressing underlying cause\r\n\r\n**White Coat Hypertension**\r\n- Elevated readings only in medical settings\r\n- Normal at home\r\n- Due to anxiety or stress\r\n- Requires home monitoring for accurate diagnosis\r\n\r\n**Masked Hypertension**\r\n- Normal readings in medical settings\r\n- Elevated at home\r\n- Increased cardiovascular risk\r\n- Requires home monitoring\r\n\r\n**Resistant Hypertension**\r\n- Remains high despite 3+ medications\r\n- Requires specialized treatment\r\n- May indicate secondary cause\r\n\r\n## Causes and Risk Factors\r\n\r\n### Primary Hypertension Risk Factors\r\n\r\n**Age**\r\n- Risk increases with age\r\n- Blood vessels become less elastic\r\n- More common after age 65\r\n\r\n**Family History and Genetics**\r\n- Strong hereditary component\r\n- Multiple genes involved\r\n- Risk doubles if both parents have hypertension\r\n- Certain ethnic groups at higher risk\r\n\r\n**Race and Ethnicity**\r\n- African Americans: Highest prevalence (40-45%)\r\n- Develops earlier and more severe\r\n- Hispanic/Latino Americans: Moderate risk\r\n- Asian Americans: Lower but increasing prevalence\r\n\r\n**Gender**\r\n- Men: Higher risk before age 55\r\n- Women: Risk increases after menopause\r\n- Pregnancy-related hypertension (preeclampsia)\r\n\r\n**Obesity and Overweight**\r\n- BMI 25 or higher increases risk\r\n- Abdominal obesity particularly dangerous\r\n- Each 10 kg weight gain increases BP by 2-3 mmHg\r\n- Weight loss of 5-10% significantly reduces BP\r\n\r\n**Physical Inactivity**\r\n- Sedentary lifestyle weakens heart\r\n- Lack of exercise increases risk by 30%\r\n- Prolonged sitting raises blood pressure\r\n- Regular activity reduces risk\r\n\r\n**Unhealthy Diet**\r\n- High sodium intake (>2,300 mg/day)\r\n- Low potassium intake\r\n- Excessive alcohol consumption\r\n- High saturated and trans fats\r\n- Processed and fast foods\r\n\r\n**Tobacco Use**\r\n- Smoking damages blood vessels\r\n- Nicotine raises blood pressure temporarily\r\n- Increases heart disease risk\r\n- Secondhand smoke also harmful\r\n\r\n**Chronic Stress**\r\n- Prolonged stress elevates blood pressure\r\n- Stress hormones constrict blood vessels\r\n- Unhealthy coping mechanisms (overeating, drinking)\r\n- Work-related stress significant factor\r\n\r\n**Sleep Disorders**\r\n- Sleep apnea strongly linked to hypertension\r\n- Poor sleep quality raises blood pressure\r\n- Less than 6 hours sleep increases risk\r\n- Disrupted circadian rhythm\r\n\r\n### Secondary Hypertension Causes\r\n\r\n**Kidney Disease**\r\n- Chronic kidney disease\r\n- Polycystic kidney disease\r\n- Renal artery stenosis\r\n- Glomerulonephritis\r\n\r\n**Endocrine Disorders**\r\n- Primary aldosteronism\r\n- Cushing's syndrome\r\n- Pheochromocytoma\r\n- Thyroid disorders\r\n- Hyperparathyroidism\r\n\r\n**Medications**\r\n- Birth control pills\r\n- Decongestants\r\n- NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen)\r\n- Corticosteroids\r\n- Some antidepressants\r\n- Immunosuppressants\r\n\r\n**Obstructive Sleep Apnea**\r\n- Repeated breathing interruptions\r\n- Oxygen deprivation\r\n- Stress hormone release\r\n- 50% of sleep apnea patients have hypertension\r\n\r\n**Coarctation of the Aorta**\r\n- Congenital heart defect\r\n- Narrowing of main artery\r\n- Usually diagnosed in childhood\r\n- Correctable with surgery\r\n\r\n**Pregnancy-Related**\r\n- Gestational hypertension\r\n- Preeclampsia\r\n- Eclampsia\r\n- HELLP syndrome\r\n\r\n## Symptoms and Warning Signs\r\n\r\n### The Silent Nature of Hypertension\r\n\r\nMost people with hypertension have NO symptoms, which is why it's called the \"silent killer.\" You can have dangerously high blood pressure for years without knowing it, while it silently damages your organs.\r\n\r\n### Rare Symptoms (Usually with Very High BP)\r\n\r\n**Headaches**\r\n- Severe, throbbing headaches\r\n- Usually in the morning\r\n- Located at back of head\r\n- May indicate hypertensive crisis\r\n\r\n**Dizziness and Lightheadedness**\r\n- Feeling unsteady\r\n- Room spinning sensation\r\n- May indicate very high or very low BP\r\n- Can lead to falls\r\n\r\n**Nosebleeds**\r\n- Frequent or severe nosebleeds\r\n- More common with very high BP\r\n- Not a reliable indicator alone\r\n\r\n**Shortness of Breath**\r\n- Difficulty breathing\r\n- Especially with exertion\r\n- May indicate heart strain\r\n- Requires medical evaluation\r\n\r\n**Chest Pain**\r\n- Pressure or

checked at every doctor visit\r\n- Adults 18-39: Every 3-5 years (if normal)\r\n- Adults 40+: Annually\r\n- High-risk individuals: More frequently\r\n\r\n**Proper Measurement Technique**\r\n- Sit quietly for 5 minutes before measurement\r\n- Empty bladder beforehand\r\n- Feet flat on floor\r\n- Arm supported at heart level\r\n- No talking during measurement\r\n- Avoid caffeine 30 minutes
