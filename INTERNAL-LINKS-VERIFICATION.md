# Internal Links Verification & Correction

## 🔍 Analysis Completed

I've thoroughly checked all internal links against the actual articles available on your website and made necessary corrections.

## ❌ Issues Found & Fixed:

### 1. **Keyword Adjustments for Better Matching**
- **Before**: `heart health exercises` (too specific, rarely matches)
- **After**: `heart exercises` (more likely to match in content)

- **Before**: `reduce stress naturally` (too long, rarely matches)
- **After**: `reduce stress` (shorter, more common)

- **Before**: `boost energy naturally` (too specific)
- **After**: `boost energy` (more common phrase)

- **Before**: `dehydration signs` (uncommon phrasing)
- **After**: `dehydration` (more common in articles)

- **Before**: `high blood pressure` (conflicts with hypertension)
- **After**: `lower blood pressure` (more specific action)
